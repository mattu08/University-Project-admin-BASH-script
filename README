This was part of a university dissertation project: Creating A Linux administration script using the “BASH” scripting language. (This was the final script)

Please read the manual: man ./matts_addusers_script_v2.0.man

To Run the Script/help:
=========================

View code in Kate, within linux, (Ubuntu).

To Run, You must run as root. e.g. sudo su <Password>. You will then need to change the directory. e.g. cd </home/user/Desktop>
sudo chmod +x matts_addusers_script.sh

Then use --> ./matts_addusers_script_v2.0.sh <-- to run the script.

End result, you should see something like this: root@user-Pc-05:/home/user/Desktop#./matts_addusers_script_v2.0.sh

The project was created to explore and resolve a problem with a slow workflow in the ACME Company, due to performing daily administrative system task manually e.g. adding new users, creating new user groups and removing users. A solution was explored and then developed, to speed up the workflow of performing these tasks with the use of script automation to solve and address the current problem. This project also identifies which scripting language is best suited through the use of analysis, from script comparisons with the justification of the use of BASH script. The final implemented script was then packaged and submitted with a user feedback survey, to gain a user’s response from the administrative script. The data collected has shown that the script was successful in showing that system automation is speeding up, workflow when performing system tasks. Moreover recommendations were given in script automation with future work and research.

Main Research in:
===================

• (Human interaction, with system automation)

• (Non- human interaction, with system automation)

• A comparison between other scripting and programming languages with example code also porting some BASH script code to Python.

• Languages used within this project: BASH Script, Python, NASM and Perl. 

•  Creating/Scripting an advanced Linux BASH script to manage the system. The script was also documented with .MAN files e.g. Manual files and was packaged in TAR.GZ.
